Removed Download from Google Code in rosettatablet.py. This is taken care of by remove_hidden_files.py.

Simplified search for words not downloaded from dict yet (in rosetta/loadword() and remove)
	Remove mp3 file after wav conversion, can now clear sounds folder of mp3s to save space

Fixed reroute to menu when activity chosen:
	added lessonon = False when menubutton pushed

Moved replacementdict work to replace_symbols(word) in download_dict_sound


Idea for navigating back to .app or .exe folder from Resources:
while DIRECTORY not in dirs:
	chdir ..
	dirs = os.walk ....
