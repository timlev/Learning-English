#Remove             if menupushed == True:
                unitmenu() from line 908

	Next:
		add picture to screen? reblit every time something is pressed -maybe only when Show Correct is pressed
		#add menu button to screen!
		#remove Bad button
		#improved speed - not using event.get(), using event = pg.event.wait() to lower CPU usage
